This code is mostly AI-generated. The sole purpose of this code was to **let my child practice and remember the number table** in a gamified way.

## Credits

I initiated the prompting with Claude.ai, then fine-tuned with Gemini 1.5 Pro 002 and ChatGPT. I took the sounds from FreeSound.org and the SVGs from SVGRepo.com.
